## 《PTU》Cracked Ruby
My own custom osu!standard skin for supported osu! clients.

Cracked ruby has it's own customizable assets in the `other-assets`folder so users can customize the skin as their own edited skin. But since this skin is in-development, the author of the skin (me) will try to add more assets for the `other-assets` folder in the skin's directory.

You may customize the combo color of the `skin.ini` file but before you edit the skin, put this one as an edit:

```
<osu! username> Edit
```

## Development Status
Last updated: Tuesday, February 28, 2023

Latest Version: v1.3.1 (*in development, fixing bugs on osu! clients*) 

I'm trying to fix some issues with the `skin.ini` file because the skin on `osu!` and `osu!lazer` defines it as `unknown`

## Note
You may credit me for the skin, but some assets we're credited to a bunch of users of their own skins.

## Cloning
Copy this command and paste it into your terminal, *make sure you have the git package installed*

```
git clone https://github.com/PayToUse/cracked-ruby
```

To install the git package before you do the command, copy this and paste it to your terminal, *and wait some time*

```
pkg install git
```

While waiting for the download to finish, there's a popup that `lets the terminal use enough space for the package`. You must type `y` and press the `Enter` key and wait for it to finish downloading the package.
